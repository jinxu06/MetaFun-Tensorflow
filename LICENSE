This project includes code from two other projects: github.com/deepmind/leo and github.com/deepmind/neural-processes. 
More specifically:
    1. leo/data.py --> metafun-tensorflow/data/classification.py
    2. leo/utils.py --> metafun-tensorflow/utils.py
    3. 'metafun-tensorflow/model.py/get_orthogonality_regularizer' is from leo/model.py
    4. 'metafun-tensorflow/model.py/Attention' is from neural-processes/attentive_neural_process.ipynb.
Significant changes to the original code (if any) are doumented in corresponding modules.
